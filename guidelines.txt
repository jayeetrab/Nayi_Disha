# Guidelines for Translation

- 
- Translate into simple and clear {target_language}, understandable by a general Indian audience.
- Preserve the meaning and intent of the original English text.
- Maintain a formal yet reader-friendly tone. Avoid overly complex or Sanskritized vocabulary.
- Translate cultural references or examples appropriately to make sense in an Indian context.
- Use proper grammar, punctuation, and respectful phrasing.
- Maintain paragraph structure and headings (if any).

# Exclusions

- Do NOT transliterate English words unless there is no native equivalent (e.g., use "इंटरनेट" only if no better word exists).
- Do NOT use hyper-local idioms or dialectal slang (e.g., avoid regional variations like "बावळट" in Marathi).
- Avoid inserting any religious, political, or biased commentary.
- Do not use overly academic or literary vocabulary unless required by the context.
- Do not add or omit any information from the original.

# Special Notes

- Preserve factual data, statistics, and names exactly as in the original.
- If a sentence is ambiguous in English, clarify it in the target language without distorting the meaning.
